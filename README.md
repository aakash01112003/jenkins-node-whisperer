# Jenkins Remoting Project

## 📘 Overview

This project sets up **Jenkins Remoting** to enable secure and scalable remote job execution on distributed nodes. By connecting Jenkins agents (slaves) to a central master/controller via remoting, we can:
- Distribute build loads across multiple machines
- Support cross-platform/architecture pipelines
- Improve security with node isolation
- Gain experience with Jenkins remote execution setups

---

## 🔧 Project Objectives

- ✅ Set up Jenkins master and connect remote nodes using remoting.
- ✅ Distribute builds and workloads to remote agents.
- ✅ Secure connections using SSH or JNLP.
- ✅ Isolate builds to reduce risk and improve performance.
- ✅ Automate agent provisioning (optional: Docker, Ansible, Terraform).

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

- Jenkins master (version 2.0+)
- Remote node(s) with:
  - Java 8+ installed
  - SSH access or JNLP connection
- Admin/root access on all machines
- Open network ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 50000 for JNLP)
- [Optional] Docker or virtualization for isolated environments

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🔹 1. Setup Jenkins Master
- Install Jenkins on your main control server:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
  wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install jenkins
````

* Start and enable the service:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start jenkins
  sudo systemctl enable jenkins
  ```

* Access Jenkins at `http://<server-ip>:8080` and complete initial setup.

---

### 🔹 2. Configure Remote Node

**Option A: Using SSH**

* On Jenkins Dashboard:

  * Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Nodes and Clouds**
  * Click **New Node** > Configure labels, # of executors
  * Choose **Launch method: Launch agents via SSH**
  * Provide remote user credentials (or SSH key)

* On the remote node:

  * Ensure Java is installed
  * Ensure SSH port (22) is open

**Option B: Using JNLP (Java Web Start)**

* On Jenkins Dashboard:

  * Configure a new node with **Launch agent by connecting it to the controller**

* On the remote agent:

  ```bash
  java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl <URL> -secret <SECRET> -workDir "/home/jenkins_agent"
  ```

---

## 🔒 Security Practices

* Use SSH keys or credentials plugins to authenticate securely.
* Restrict node access via firewalls or VPNs.
* Run agents inside containers or VMs for sandboxing.
* Assign specific labels to restrict which jobs run on which nodes.

---

## 🧪 Test Jobs

Create a freestyle or pipeline job and assign it to a specific node label:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent { label 'linux-node' }

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Running on remote node!'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📈 Benefits of Remoting

* Scalable and distributed build architecture
* Supports legacy and heterogeneous systems
* Reduced load on master/controller
* Isolation = security + reliability
